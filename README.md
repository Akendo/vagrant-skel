# vagrant-skel #

Simple Vagrant environment to bootstrap a puppetmaster quickly.

## About ##

This is a simple skel project that allows to set up a fast Vagrant environment, based
on Ubuntu 12.04 and up. This includes a puppetmaster in the latest version of puppet
and one additional VM.

## How to use ##

Just run a simple:

    vagrant up

Feel free to modify everything inside of the `manifests/` folder and then
run the puppet-agent.

For example, modify the `manifests/nodes.pp` and add the `vim` package:

    node 'example.vbox.net' {
     # Make sure that the package 'vim' is installed.
     package { "vim":
       ensure => installed,
        }
    }

### Getting the latest changes to the VM:

    vagrant ssh example -c 'sudo puppet agent -v -t'

## Caveats ##

I apply a small hack to save some bandwidth, the `/var/cache/apt/archives/` will
be mount in the local folder `tmp/`. Sometimes this causes issues with the installation
of packages. Emptying the `tmp/` folder or disabling the `synced_folder` inside of the `Vagrantfile` 
may solve it.
